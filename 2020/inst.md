# Installation - General considerations

!> Release 2020 SPS02 is not downward compatible with releases prior to 2020 FPS01. It should **not** be installed on top those releases. If you have used releases prior to 2020 FPS01 and would like to move to release 2020 SPS02 then you need to move your data manually. If you need help with moving you data please contact our project manager for an offer (gm@nypesap.com)

### Overview

To install Fiori Tracker please follow the installations guides that are in the **Installation** section of each product page. 

We designed each Fiori Tracker Suite product to work independently. Once you install the product and any dependent products are needed, it will guide the user to install those.
