On which system to install Fiori Tracker? - Gateway or Solution Manager?

There is one set of transports and Fiori Tracker will work on both: Solman and Gateway. Only SAP Gateway functionality is needed in order to run Fiori Tracker.

It's better to run it on SolMan though.

Here are the resons:

1. With time Fiori Tracker becomes a repository of the vital documentation of your setup
You are going to need Fiori Tracker the most at times when your SAP Gateway undergoes the changes and could be offline or inaccessible. For example during upgrades or issues with Fiori content. 

2. Many Fiori Tracker users chose to use it during the preparation phase when Gateway system might not be installed yet. 
3. Another reason is that Fiori Tracker is aimed towards your project team members and in most cases, not all project team members have users on Gateway.
