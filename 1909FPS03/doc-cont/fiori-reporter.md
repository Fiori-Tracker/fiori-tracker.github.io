# Fiori Report - Jira integration

With Fiori Reporter, you can ease your bug reporting. In most situations, the user doesn't know how to describe precisely his problem to the technician team, so it longs the time of the solution. With Fiori Reporter, all user has to do is to explain his problem with his words. Fiori Reporter captures the application name that the user has a problem with; it also takes a screenshot of a problematic view so that the technician team can get all the needed information with only one message.
