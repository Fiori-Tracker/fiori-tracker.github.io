# Documenting SAP Fiori launchpad content

You can document your "to-be" state of Fiori launchpad content using applications from group "Fiori Tracker".

This is what You see after entering Fiori Tracker - Fiori Tracker Launchpad. It contains two modes - Display (upper) and Administration mode (bottom). In Administration mode You can modify Your Fiori Tracker and see features that are not available in Display mode. To see what those features are - go to section Feature Overview.
