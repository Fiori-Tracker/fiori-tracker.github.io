# Documenting SAP Fiori launchpad content

You can document your "to-be" state of Fiori launchpad content using applications from group "Fiori Tracker".

## Application Overview

After choosing Applications from the main menu You can see an empty page – that will change in just one moment, but! At the bottom right of that page You can see three icons that was not there before. 
By clicking on the first one You can Export to CSV Your Application list. The second one can take You to Business Catalogs tab – just like that! And the last one will transport You to Roles tab.

Now, look at the Application List view - You can either tap name of the application You need or press Enter/ Search to list all apps. Next to Application List You can see counter – this is how much apps Your Fiori Tracker contains. 

When You start typing Your apps Name – Fiori Tracker is going to help You find the one You need!
