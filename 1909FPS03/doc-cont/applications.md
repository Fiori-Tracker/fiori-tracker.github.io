# Applications Overview

After choosing Applications from the main menu You can see an empty page – that will change in just one moment, but! At the bottom right of that page You can see three icons that was not there before. 
By clicking on the first one You can Export to CSV Your Application list. The second one can take You to Business Catalogs tab – just like that! And the last one will transport You to Roles tab.

Now, look at the Application List view - You can either tap name of the application You need or press Enter/ Search to list all apps. Next to Application List You can see counter – this is how much apps Your Fiori Tracker contains. 

When You start typing Your apps Name – Fiori Tracker is going to help You find the one You need!

**After choosing one app that You want to work with**

All the technical information that You need to work with an app is right here! You can see everything about that app. Starting from its name through Technical catalog, Semantic object and Semantic action to Relations that app has with Business Catalogs or with Roles, You can even see the whole Relations Graph – from app itself to end-users! 
To be tab is the ideal situation – we want Your system to look like this at the end of Fiori Tracker implementation.  

After You chose listed app, that You need, here is what You will see:
