# Location of Central system: S/4 HANA QAS or SAP Solution Manager?

You can install Fiori Tracker Central system components on any SAP Gateway.

Three of the most popular deployment options are described in [Deployment section](/deployment/intro.md)

Some considerations to be taken into account:

1. As Fiori Tracker becomes a repository of the vital documentation of your setup you are going to need it the most at times when your SAP Gateway systems undergo the changes and could be offline or inaccessible. For example, during upgrades or issues with Fiori content. In this case it is worth to consider to locate Fiori Tracker outside of the landscape, for example on SAP Solution Manager.

2. Many Fiori Tracker users chose to use it during the preparation phase when your S/4 HANA landscape is not yet installed but SAP Solution Manager is already available. 

3. Main Fiori Tracker users are the members of project team. In some cases, not all project team members have users in S/4 HANA landscape but they might have in SAP Solution Manager.
