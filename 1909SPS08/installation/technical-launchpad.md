# Technical launchpad

Fiori Tracker Technical launchpad is a standalone UI5 app with simplified tiles that allows you to start Fiori Tracker in case the standard SAP Fiori Launchpad is not available. Technical launchpad is also handy when you do not have roles and SAP Fiori launchpad configured yet.

To start Technical launchpad, open the following address in your browser:

**yourhost:port**/sap/bc/ui5_ui5/sap/zfioritracker/</br>

f.e. https://demo.fioritracker.org/sap/bc/ui5_ui5/sap/zfioritracker/

> It is possible to set Fiori Tracker to load the UI5 library in any available version (not only your default systems version) as long as the files are available. In the worse case, the lib files can be loaded from SAP servers on the public internet.
