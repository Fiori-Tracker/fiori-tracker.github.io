# Configuration

As Fiori Tracker administrator, you can configure the platform by adjusting config parameters of configuration tables.

Each configurable feature has it's config table and the corresponding entry in [SAP Gui based transaction](/conf/changing-config.md) `ZFTSETUP`.

There are two areas of configuration that set how Fiori Tracker Main part works:

1. [Main configuration](/conf/conf.md) table - it collects parameters that influence Main part general functions

2. Feature configuration tables - dedicated to specific Main part functions. The configurable functions include:
- [Area codes](/conf/area-codes.md)
- [Application types](/conf/app-types.md)
- [Sign-off types](/conf/signoff-types.md)
- [Provisioning types](/conf/prov-types.md)
- [User to area mapping](/conf/area-mapping.md)
- [Uer to type mapping](/conf/type-mapping.md)
