# Fiori Tracker

>One of the biggest problems that we run into with SAP S/4 HANA implementations is crazy-long hours we spend on SAP Fiori apps governance. With Fiori Tracker you can cut this time down and increase your production value at the same time.

We are sharing Fiori Tracker at no cost with everybody so everyone can save time and get working SAP Fiori apps quicker.

#### Fiori Tracker:

- Replaces vast Excel sheets containing application details and its assignments to catalogs, groups, and roles that are hard to share.
- Brings a centrally managed view, enriched with details pulled directly from SAP systems.
- Makes clear who from the team is responsible for the parts of Fiori launchpad configuration.
- Enforces naming conventions.
- Speeds up reporting issues discovered while testing or using apps.
- Reports statistics on apps usage (apps popularity).

#### What it is?

Fiori Tracker is a free SAP Fiori application that runs on SAP Solution Manager and serves as a central registry of the Fiori applications that you are implementing or supporting in your SAP S/4 HANA system.

App stays free as Nype is involved in developing if for exposure only.
