# Fiori Tracker

>One of the biggest problems that we run into with SAP S/4 HANA implementations is crazy-long hours we spend on SAP Fiori apps governance. With Fiori Tracker you can reduce this time drastically.

#### What it is?

It is Fiori at scale tooling that reduces the effort needed for deploying apps in Fiori launchpad.

It shapes the project work, avoid common stumble points, and cut the required time from weeks down to days.

Fiori Tracker runs on SAP Solution Manager and serves as a central registry of the Fiori applications that you are implementing or supporting in your SAP Gateway (for both SAP Business Suite and SAP S/4 HANA systems).

#### Fiori Tracker:

- Replaces vast Excel sheets containing application details and its assignments to catalogs, groups, and roles that are hard to share.
- Brings a centrally managed view, enriched with details pulled directly from SAP systems.
- Makes clear who from the team is responsible for the parts of Fiori launchpad configuration.
- Enforces naming conventions.
- Speeds up reporting issues discovered while testing or using apps.
- Reports statistics on apps usage (apps popularity).

We are sharing Fiori Tracker at no cost with everybody so everyone can save time and get working SAP Fiori apps quicker.
