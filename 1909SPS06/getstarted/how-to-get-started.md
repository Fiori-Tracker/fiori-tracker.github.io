## Create an app

You can create an entry for your Fiori application, so you can easily carry out your documentation through the whole implementation process (and maintenance).

You can specify fields for your entry and assign it to the catalogs.

The whole entry has 'To be' (for blueprinting your solution) and 'As is' (for already implemented ones) sections.
