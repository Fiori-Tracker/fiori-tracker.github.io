# Troubleshooting

There are two function that can help you resolve issues with Firoi Tracker:

- connection status check
- Odata services smoke test

Start the option from `Admin tools` section of 'ZFTSETUP'.

# Connection status check for Managed systems

Point 1 starts the check connection report. I check connection between your Central system and Fiori Tracker plugins and addons installed on your Managed systems.

# OData services smoke test

Point 2 starts a status check for all Firoi Tracker OData services. If everything works correctly then all services should have green squares next to them.
