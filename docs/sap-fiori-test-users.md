# "Fiori Test Users " - speed up your SAP Fiori app testing 

SAP Fiori applications are created with specific user roles in mind, so testing must be aligned accordingly. Conducting role-based testing with test users who have the relevant roles is essential. This approach avoids issues that arise from using project members' personal users, such as:

- Missing SAP functional configuration, parameterization, or user-specific test data
- Inconsistent results due to varying application behavior per personal user ("it works for me!")
