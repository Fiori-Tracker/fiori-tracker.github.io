# Customer reference preparation

## Intro

We offer Fiori Tracker for free to customers who are willing to provide a publishable customer reference.

## Input

Below is the description of what we need:

??? "1. Description of your SAP landscape"
    
    === "Details"

        - Number of SAP Fiori applications used
        - Number of catalogs
        - Number of roles
        - Number of end-users

    === "Example"

        - 760 Fiori launchpad-enabled applications
        - 220 Catalogs
        - 150 Roles
        - 980 end-users

??? "2. Description of the project"

    === "Details"

        - Main SAP product and its release number 
        - Main business processes monitored with this system
        - Name of the team that is planning to operate Fiori Tracker 
        - Current phase of the project

    === "Example"

        - SAP S/4HANA 2021
        - Lead to Agreement, Service Delivery, Account to Report, Order to Cash, Procure to Pay
        - SAP Technology Platform team
        - Support after go-live in May 2024


??? "3. Description of three or more planned use cases for the Fiori Tracker"
    
    === "Details"

        See the [use cases we have identified](usecases/index.md).

    === "Example"

        - Support of SAP Gateway migration
        - App Optimization: Identify key apps, deprecate others
        - Focus on performance improvements post-migration
        - Streamlining apps for faster deployment

??? "4. A project member who can provide a testimonial on planned use cases."

    === "Details"

        We need the first and last name, role in the SAP S/4HANA project, and the contents of the testimonial. We can provide a prompt to make it super easy.

    === "Example"

        We plan to use Fiori Tracker Suite for our migration from Standalone Gateway to Embedded Gateway. With Fiori Tracker, we aim to identify the most important apps and those that can be deprecated, simplifying the upgrade team's workload.

        Post-migration, we will also focus on improving performance. Fiori Tracker will help us streamline our app portfolio, ensuring the embedded deployment runs faster and more efficiently.

## Process steps

1. Once we have the above, we prepare a draft of the article (called "Customer Reference") 
2. We send it to you for approval
3. We publish this customer reference article on the Fiori Tracker page, LinkedIn, and SAP Community.
4. We are sending you the transport files and instructions on installing the product
5. If needed, we support you with installation 
    - Call with screen sharing
    - Discord
    - If we get access to your system, we can install it for you

6. You start using Fiori Tracker
7. After one month of use, we would adopt the testimonial describing the feedback regarding actual experience with the tool
