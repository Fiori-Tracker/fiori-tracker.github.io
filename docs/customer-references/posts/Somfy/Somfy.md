    *Fiori Tracker gave us clear visibility into how our apps are actually being used. By monitoring usage, we quickly identified which apps are critical, which are rarely accessed, and which we could retire. This insight helps us optimize our catalogs and streamline user roles, reducing complexity across the landscape.*

    *We also used this data to optimize our SAP licenses, avoiding overspending on applications that did not add value. As we prepare for the SAP S/4HANA upgrade, this level of insight will be critical to ensuring a controlled and efficient upgrade.*
