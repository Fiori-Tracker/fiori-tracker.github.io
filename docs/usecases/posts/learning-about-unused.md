# Learning about unused applications

Make the most of your system by identifying unused applications

<!-- more -->

## Problem statement

If you've had SAP S/4HANA for a while, you likely have dozens (if not hundreds) of Fiori apps configured. But how many of those are actually in use? For many businesses, the answer is surprisingly low—often, half or more of the apps remain untouched.

## Solution overview

The Fiori App Usage Report helps you see which applications are underutilized or unused, giving you valuable insights to make the most of your SAP S/4HANA system.

## Why this matters
Identifying unused apps can:

- Highlight areas where employees might need additional training
- Reveal issues that could be discouraging business from using specific apps (complex interfaces or irrelevant features)
- Uncover potential to streamline processes by promoting useful, underutilized apps
- For consulting partners creates opportunities for consultation

## Bottom Line

With the Fiori App Usage Report, you can ensure you’re fully leveraging your SAP S/4HANA system, reducing waste, and potentially unlocking new productivity gains.
