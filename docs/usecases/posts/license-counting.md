# Matching SAP user licenses to real user needs

Cut SAP license costs by tracking real Fiori app usage.

<!-- more -->

## Objective 
Help SAP S/4HANA project teams monitor and optimize SAP user licenses based on actual Fiori app usage, ultimately reducing unnecessary licensing costs.

## Problem Statement
SAP licenses can be a significant recurring cost, especially when users have more access than needed. Traditional user license management is manual and doesnâ€™t account for real app usage, leading to underused or misallocated licenses. This results in overspending and makes it harder to control licensing costs as the user base grows.

## Solution Overview
Fiori Tracker provides insights into which users are actively using which Fiori apps and at what frequency. By tracking real app usage, project teams can make informed decisions about which licenses are essential and which can be reassigned or downgraded. The goal is to minimize license costs by matching user roles and needs more accurately with actual system usage.

## Key features

1. User activity tracking

    - Captures real-time data on Fiori app usage at the individual user level
    - Identifies active vs. inactive users to highlight potential license optimizations.

2. App tracking

    - Analyzes used apps to suggest appropriate license types based on actual needs


## Benefits

1. Cost Savings: Reduce spend by eliminating or downgrading unused licenses.
2. Data-Driven Decisions: Base license allocation on actual user activity, not assumptions.
3. Simplicity: Automated, real-time tracking saves time compared to manual license audits.

## Target Audience

1. SAP S/4HANA project team members focused on cost control especially SAP Project managers
2. License managers responsible for SAP licensing budgets
3. SAP Basis team managing user access and compliance
