# SAP Fiori launchpad configuration - handover to support

Transferring SAP Fiori launchpad setup know-how after the implementation

<!-- more -->

Your support team will begin receiving end-user questions once the system is live. They need a clear understanding of the SAP Fiori launchpad setup to prevent any disruptions. Small teams can easily manage the handover. During large SAP projects, your support team might belong to a separate organization. Sometimes, an external consulting firm might take over support post-implementation. In such situations, it is essential to have a support handover document. Fiori Tracker holds all this vital information structured and in one place.
