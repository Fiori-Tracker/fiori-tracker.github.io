# Creating technical documentation for SAP Fiori Apps

Technical documentation starts with listing what you need to document. .

## Objective 

Help SAP S/4HANA project teams maintain up-to-date technical documentation for custom and extended apps.

## Problem statement

The lack of clear technical documentation makes troubleshooting issues take longer, forces new developers to face a steep learning curve, and slows any planned upgrades. Without a clear understanding of extensions and custom code, even minor changes can lead to errors. These mistakes might cause data loss, security vulnerabilities, or process disruptions.

## Solution Overview

Fiori Tracker keeps a Master list of SAP Fiori launchpad applications. The list includes customs and extended applications with App IDs, which are the foundation of your technical documentation. The app list shows the extent of custom solutions in the project, and app IDs help connect these with external docs. For example, naming your git repository after the app ID makes it easy to find source code, comments, and commit history. The same goes for Word or PDF docsâ€”organizing by app ID keeps documentation current.

## Key features
1. Application list
2. Filtering on the "App type" property
   
    - You can list all custom and extended apps and get a list of the required technical documentation.

3. "App Area" property 
   
    - The person responsible for the area allows the identification of the functional analyst accountable for app requirements.

## Benefits

1. Cost Savings
3. Simplicity

## Target Audience

1. SAP Fiori developer
2. Project managers
