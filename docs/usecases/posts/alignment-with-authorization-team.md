# Ensuring alignment with the authorization team needs

The app, catalog, and roles in Fiori Tracker form a clear blueprint, providing the Roles and authorization team with the clarity they need to configure the system. The same records are available for inspection by functional analysts, project managers, and other project members, regardless of their expertise and access. All project members can reference records kept in Fiori Tracker and request needed changes. Whether it's a new application or an adjustment in the catalog structure, the Roles and Authorization team will receive the necessary input in the proper form. This clarity makes launchpad adjustments faster and safer for end-users.
