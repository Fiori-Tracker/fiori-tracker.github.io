# Security logs

Strengthen security with App Usage Logs

<!-- more -->

## Objective 

Enable SAP S/4HANA teams to monitor Fiori app usage for security insights, detect anomalies, and improve compliance by leveraging real-time security logs.

## Problem statement

SAP systems hold sensitive business data, making them prime targets for misuse and breaches. However, tracking security events in traditional systems is cumbersome and often lacks visibility into app-specific activity. Without clear insights, unusual patterns of app usage—like unauthorized access or abnormal behavior—can slip through the cracks, leading to compliance risks and potential data exposure.

## Solution Overview

Fiori Tracker collects app usage data to provide a detailed view of who accessed what, when, and how. By correlating user activity with security events, project teams can detect suspicious behavior, enforce security policies, and ensure compliance with auditing requirements.

## Key features

1. User Activity Logging

    - Captures detailed logs of Fiori app usage, tracking user launching apps in real-time. Provides visibility into logins, and all Fiori launchpad-level actions.


## Benefits

1. Enhanced Security: Detect and address suspicious behavior early
2. Audit-Ready: Simplify compliance with detailed usage and security logs
2. Proactive Risk Management: Prevent breaches by continuously monitoring SAP Fiori launchpad-level activity.

## Target Audience

1. SAP S/4HANA security teams managing user access and compliance
2. IT administrators tasked with monitoring system activity
3. Internal audit and risk management professionals ensuring data protection
