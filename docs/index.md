# Track your SAP Fiori launchpad apps

Fiori Tracker [streamlines SAP Fiori app management](satisfied-interests-and-roles.md), reducing delays. It connects app records with catalogs, roles, and [usage data](https://help.fioriappsusage.org), making it easier to [gather and maintain requirements](usecases/posts/requirements-gathering.md) for SAP Fiori launchpad content.

## Trusted by our customers

!!! quote " "

    The Fiori App Usage report, part of the Fiori Tracker Suite, has helped us tremendously in the preparation for our upgrade from S4HANA 1809 with a standalone Gateway to S4HANA 2022 Embedded Gateway. Clearly showing which apps were the most important and which could be deprecated, reducing the scope/workload for the upgrade team.  This analysis alone is an almost impossible task without Fiori Tracker, while SAP captures such analytics for every user, it is cryptic and difficult/impossible to mine. The Fiori App Usage Report makes this very clear and easy.

    The report has also helped us, more than once, to audit which user had executed -unwillingly- a certain wrong action, enabling us to further optimize the roles associated to the App. The Fiori Tracker Suite is filling a huge gap left by SAP to make such usage statistics visible to the customer.
