# Step 4 - Assign Authorization role

## 1. Assign role

Go to transaction *SU01* and assign the `Role` to all users who should access the installed product.

!!! Note

    If roles are missing, make sure you specified the target client when importing Fiori Tracker transports. Without it, client-specific roles wonâ€™t import.
