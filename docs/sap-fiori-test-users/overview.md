# Fiori Test Users - speed up your SAP Fiori app testing 

SAP Fiori applications are created with specific user roles in mind, so testing must be aligned accordingly. Conducting role-based testing with test users who have the relevant roles is essential. This approach also helps to avoid issues that may arise from using project members' personal accounts, such as:

- Missing SAP functional configuration, parameterization, or user-specific test data
- Inconsistent results due to varying application behavior per personal user ("it works for me!")

## Feature highlights

The "Fiori Test Users" app lets you create, change, and list test user records. Test user records are linked directly with roles and indirectly with catalogs and apps.

Section with content type [Test users and their passwords](../tracked/SPS03/testusers.md) gives a detailed overview.

You can use the app to keep [Centralized test users lists with passwords](../usecases/posts/test-users.md).
