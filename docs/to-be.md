# Specification records

The Specification records are part of your project's technical specification. During implementation, they define the project's deliverables, and during support, they document what is operational. Specifications records bridge the gap between business requirements and technical execution. Without clear and detailed specifications, projects often face miscommunication or rework.
 
Working with Specification records is particularly valuable during:

1. Functional and technical teams' joint efforts to define the content in the preparation phase. They serve as a blueprint during the implementation phase.

2. While the support team resolves issues with systems. The team can use them to verify the expected system configuration.

In addition to Specification records, Fiori Tracker suite leverages two more types of records: 

1. ["As-is"](as-is.md)
2. ["Info records"](info-records.md)
