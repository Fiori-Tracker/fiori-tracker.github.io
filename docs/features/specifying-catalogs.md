# Specifying SAP Fiori launchpad catalogs

This feature lets you create documentation entries for your launchpad Business Catalogs. The feature is available in app called `FT Catalogs` and starts with the list of the catalogs in the project scope:

*Starting view of `FT Catalogs` app*

`Add` button creates an entry for the new catalog:

*Create catalog record form in the `FT Catalogs` app*

The app uses the same functional area set to assign catalog and use Fiori Tracker reports on a specific stream or to assign stream default person responsible for sing-offs.
