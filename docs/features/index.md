The main application that showcases the most popular applications in your S/4HANA system is the [Fiori App Usage Report](usage-report.md). This report provides insights into last week's and today's total launch counts for all SAP Fiori launchpad-enabled applications. Additionally, the [User usage report](user-usage-report.md) lists every app a user accessed and the access count for each app. Furthermore, the [Usage log report](usage-log.md) presents a comprehensive list of all count records, including system, username, app ID, and name, as well as the date and time of the start. You can further analyze these usage log records using your preferred analytical tool.
