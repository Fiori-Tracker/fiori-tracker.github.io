Is it really free? Yes, it is. We are able to maintain Fiori Tracker with an income that commercial pieces of Fiori Tracker Suite provide. 2. Does Fiori Tracker send any data (statistics) to the outside servers (what is the security model)? Fiori Tracker is not sending any data to outside servers. Fiori Tracker does not need external access, and many users run it on installations that do not have external access. All code is in ABAP, meaning that it is fully transparent and available for inspection. 3. Is Premier support mandatory after a certain time period? No. Premier support is optional. You can continue using Fiori Tracker as it is, as long as you want, free of charge. 4. What are the prerequisites/minimal requirements for installation? The minimal requirement is any SAP system with GAP Gateway (software component SAP_GWFND) on SAP NetWeaver version at least 7.52 ( see details ) 5. Will the Fiori Tracker release 2020 work on my S/4 HANA system on a different release (1610, 1709, 1809, 1909, 2021)? Yes. Fiori Tracker release numbering is independent of SAP release numbering. Fiori Tracker release 2020 is compatible with SAP S/4 HANA releases from 1610 to 2021. Refer Minimal requirements for more details. 6. What details do you need for troubleshooting the issues? Please send the screenshots of the application running in Chrome with URL and \"Developer tools\" console. Screenshot from respective SAP Gateway system from SAP Gui menu: System->Status SAP System Data -> Details. 7. What are the features that are available for free version (1909 SPS06) and licensed version (2020 FPS01)? In terms of features, both versions are almost the same. The main difference is in architecture. We have developed version 2020 FPS01 in a way that keeps Fiori Tracker Suite components independent. It is easier to support, maintain, and extend them. If you have not found the answer to your questions in our online help, please reach out to us on Fiori Tracker Slack or create an issue on GitHub . 8. How to de-install Fiori Tracker components? To de-install Fiori Tracker components, please perform the reverse of the installation steps in the reverse order. For import transports steps perform the deletion of the objects from the component's transport package. 9. Why would I need a dedicated app instead of the shared Excel spreadsheet or Atlassian Confulence page? App records kept in the spreadsheet cause many challenges. Here are the most important ones: Unauthorized, accidental modification causing inconsistencies Lack of history and origin of changes Duplication Lack of 1 to N relation maintenance See \"The challenges of storing Fiori content records in the spreadsheet\" for more details.","title":"Fiori Tracker - Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"faq/#fiori-tracker-frequently-asked-questions","text":"","title":"Fiori Tracker - Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"faq/#1-is-it-really-free","text":"Yes, it is.

Variable Type Content pretty function ( var_list, rows, header, e ) Default mkdocs_macro Prettify a dictionary or object (used for environment documentation, or debugging). Builtin Jinja2 Filters These filters are provided by Jinja2 as a standard. See also the Jinja2 documentation on builtin filters ). Variable Type Content abs builtin_function_or_method Return the absolute value of the argument. attr function ( environment, obj, name, value ) Get an attribute of an object. foo|attr(\"bar\") works like foo.bar just that always an attribute is returned and items are not looked up. batch function ( value, linecount, fill_with, tmp, item ) A filter that batches items. It works pretty much like slice just the other way round. It returns a list of lists with the given number of items. If you provide a second parameter this is used to fill up missing items. See this example. capitalize function ( s ) Capitalize a value. The first character will be uppercase, all others lowercase. center function ( value, width ) Centers the value in a field of a given width. count builtin_function_or_method Return the number of items in a container. d function ( value, default_value, boolean ) If the value is undefined it will return the passed default value, otherwise the value of the variable. default function ( value, default_value, boolean ) If the value is undefined it will return the passed default value, otherwise the value of the variable. dictsort function ( value, case_sensitive, by, reverse, sort_func ) Sort a dict and yield (key, value) pairs. Python dicts may not be in the order you want to display them in, so sort them first. e builtin_function_or_method Replace the characters & , < , > , ' , and \" in the string with HTML-safe sequences. Use this if you need to display text that might contain such characters in HTML. escape builtin_function_or_method Replace the characters & , < , > , ' , and \" in the string with HTML-safe sequences. Use this if you need to display text that might contain such characters in HTML. filesizeformat function ( value, binary, bytes, base, prefixes, i, prefix, unit ) Format the value like a 'human-readable' file size (i.e. 13 kB, 4.1 MB, 102 Bytes, etc). Per default decimal prefixes are used (Mega, Giga, etc.), if the second parameter is set to True the binary prefixes are used (Mebi, Gibi). first function ( args, kwargs, b ) Return the first item of a sequence. float function ( value, default ) Convert the value into a floating point number. If the conversion doesn't work it will return 0.0 . You can override this default using the first parameter. forceescape function ( value ) Enforce HTML escaping. This will probably double escape variables. format function ( value, args, kwargs ) Apply the given values to a printf-style _ format string, like string % values . groupby function ( args, kwargs, b ) Group a sequence of objects by an attribute using Python's :func: itertools.groupby . The attribute can use dot notation for nested access, like \"address.city\" . Unlike Python's groupby , the values are sorted first so only one group is returned for each unique value. indent function ( s, width, first, blank, newline, rv, lines ) Return a copy of the string with each line indented by 4 spaces. The first line and blank lines are not indented by default. int function ( value, default, base ) Convert the value into an integer. If the conversion doesn't work it will return 0 . You can override this default using the first parameter. You can also override the default base (10) in the second parameter, which handles input with prefixes such as 0b, 0o and 0x for bases 2, 8 and 16 respectively. The base is ignored for decimal numbers and non-string values. join function ( args, kwargs, b ) Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in the sequence. The separator between elements is an empty string per default, you can define it with the optional parameter. last function ( environment, seq ) Return the last item of a sequence. length builtin_function_or_method Return the number of items in a container. list function ( args, kwargs, b ) Convert the value into a list. If it was a string the returned list will be a list of characters. lower function ( s ) Convert a value to lowercase. map function ( args, kwargs, b ) Applies a filter on a sequence of objects or looks up an attribute. This is useful when dealing with lists of objects but you are really only interested in a certain value of it. min function ( environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute ) Return the smallest item from the sequence. max function ( environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute ) Return the largest item from the sequence. pprint function ( value ) Pretty print a variable. Useful for debugging. random function ( context, seq ) Return a random item from the sequence. reject function ( args, kwargs, b ) Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to each object, and rejecting the objects with the test succeeding. rejectattr function ( args, kwargs, b ) Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to the specified attribute of each object, and rejecting the objects with the test succeeding. replace function ( eval_ctx, s, old, new, count ) Return a copy of the value with all occurrences of a substring replaced with a new one. The first argument is the substring that should be replaced, the second is the replacement string. If the optional third argument count is given, only the first count occurrences are replaced. reverse function ( value, rv, e ) Reverse the object or return an iterator that iterates over it the other way round. round function ( value, precision, method, func ) Round the number to a given precision. The first parameter specifies the precision (default is 0 ), the second the rounding method. safe function ( value ) Mark the value as safe which means that in an environment with automatic escaping enabled this variable will not be escaped. select function ( args, kwargs, b ) Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to each object, and only selecting the objects with the test succeeding. selectattr function ( args, kwargs, b ) Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to the specified attribute of each object, and only selecting the objects with the test succeeding. slice function ( args, kwargs, b ) Slice an iterator and return a list of lists containing those items. Useful if you want to create a div containing three ul tags that represent columns. sort function ( environment, value, reverse, case_sensitive, attribute, key_func ) Sort an iterable using Python's :func: sorted . string builtin_function_or_method Convert an object to a string if it isn't already. This preserves a :class: Markup string rather than converting it back to a basic string, so it will still be marked as safe and won't be escaped again. striptags function ( value ) Strip SGML/XML tags and replace adjacent whitespace by one space. sum function ( args, kwargs, b ) Returns the sum of a sequence of numbers plus the value of parameter 'start' (which defaults to 0). When the sequence is empty it returns start. title function ( s ) Return a titlecased version of the value. I.e. words will start with uppercase letters, all remaining characters are lowercase. trim function ( value, chars ) Strip leading and trailing characters, by default whitespace. truncate function ( env, s, length, killwords, end, leeway, result ) Return a truncated copy of the string. The length is specified with the first parameter which defaults to 255 . If the second parameter is true the filter will cut the text at length. Otherwise it will discard the last word. If the text was in fact truncated it will append an ellipsis sign ( \"...\" ). If you want a different ellipsis sign than \"...\" you can specify it using the third parameter. Strings that only exceed the length by the tolerance margin given in the fourth parameter will not be truncated. unique function ( environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute, getter, seen, item, key ) Returns a list of unique items from the given iterable. upper function ( s ) Convert a value to uppercase. urlencode function ( value, items ) Quote data for use in a URL path or query using UTF-8. urlize function ( eval_ctx, value, trim_url_limit, nofollow, target, rel, extra_schemes, policies, rel_parts, scheme, rv ) Convert URLs in text into clickable links. wordcount function ( s ) Count the words in that string. wordwrap function ( environment, s, width, break_long_words, wrapstring, break_on_hyphens ) Wrap a string to the given width. Existing newlines are treated as paragraphs to be wrapped separately. xmlattr function ( eval_ctx, d, autospace, rv ) Create an SGML/XML attribute string based on the items in a dict. All values that are neither none nor undefined are automatically escaped. tojson function ( eval_ctx, value, indent, policies, dumps, kwargs ) Serialize an object to a string of JSON, and mark it safe to render in HTML. This filter is only for use in HTML documents.","title":"Info"},{"location":"info/#macros-plugin-environment","text":"","title":"Macros Plugin Environment"},{"location":"info/#general-list","text":"All available variables and filters within the macros plugin: Variable Type Content extra dict social = [{'icon': 'fontawesome/brands/linkedin', 'link': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/fiori-tracker/'}, {'icon': 'fontawesome/brands/twitter', 'link': 'http://twitter.com/fioritracker'}, {'icon': 'fontawesome/brands/youtube', 'link': 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6bx5QiaM3KRE8qgshBrurg'}], prod [ dict ] config Config config_file_path = 'D:\\\\vs\\\\ft-help\\\\mkdocs.yml', site_name = 'Fiori Tracker', nav = [{'User manual': 'user-manual.md'}, {'Learn more': 'learn-more.md'}, {'Installation': 'inst.md'}, {'Support': 'support.md'}, {'Impressum': 'impressum.md'}], pages [ NoneType ], site_url = 'https://help.fioritracker.org/V2020/', site_description [ NoneType ], site_author [ NoneType ], theme [ Theme ], docs_dir = 'D:\\\\vs\\\\ft-help\\\\docs', site_dir = 'D:\\\\vs\\\\ft-help\\\\site', copyright = 'Copyright \u00a9 2016 - 2022 Nype', google_analytics [ NoneType ], dev_addr [ Address ], use_directory_urls = True, repo_url = '', repo_name = '', edit_uri = '', extra_css = ['stylesheets/extra.css'], extra_javascript = [], extra_templates = [], markdown_extensions = ['toc', 'tables', 'fenced_code', 'admonition', 'pymdownx.emoji'], mdx_configs [ dict ], strict = False, remote_branch = 'gh-pages', remote_name = 'origin', extra [ SubConfig ], plugins [ PluginCollection ] environment dict system = 'Windows', system_version = '10', python_version = '3.10.0', mkdocs_version = '1.2.3', macros_plugin_version = '0.6.0', jinja2_version = '3.0.2' plugin Config module_name = 'main', modules = [], include_dir = '', include_yaml = [], j2_block_start_string = '', j2_block_end_string = '', j2_variable_start_string = '', j2_variable_end_string = '', verbose = False git dict status = True, date [ datetime ], short_commit = 'e930b2c', commit = 'e930b2c0b67b19e22b4404b9fa9c41c6e5ce13c7', author = 'gmal', tag = '', date_ISO = '2023-04-15 22:43:44 +0200', message = 'upd', raw = 'commit e930b2c0b67b19e22b4404b9fa9c41c6e5ce13c7\\nAuthor: gmal \\nDate: Sat Apr 15 22:43:44 2023 +0200\\n\\n upd', root_dir = 'D:/vs/ft-help' social list [{'icon': 'fontawesome/brands/linkedin', 'link': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/fiori-tracker/'}, {'icon': 'fontawesome/brands/twitter', 'link': 'http://twitter.com/fioritracker'}, {'icon': 'fontawesome/brands/youtube', 'link': 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6bx5QiaM3KRE8qgshBrurg'}] prod dict core [ dict ], asisCen [ dict ], asisMan [ dict ], catAppRep [ dict ], cr [ dict ], ac [ dict ], ca [ dict ], fa [ dict ], fap [ dict ], ftCatsRelAppsAsis [ dict ], ftAppsRelCatsAsis [ dict ], ftAppsRelAppsUsage [ dict ], ch [ dict ], RelCh [ dict ], so [ dict ], tu [ dict ], RelTu [ dict ], hi [ dict ], co [ dict ], RelSo [ dict ], ro [ dict ], ci [ dict ], ai [ dict ], mi [ dict ], RelRo [ dict ], gv [ dict ] macros SuperDict context [ function ], macros_info [ function ], now [ function ], fix_url [ function ] filters dict pretty [ function ] filters_builtin dict abs [ builtin_function_or_method ], attr [ function ], batch [ function ], capitalize [ function ], center [ function ], count [ builtin_function_or_method ], d [ function ], default [ function ], dictsort [ function ], e [ builtin_function_or_method ], escape [ builtin_function_or_method ], filesizeformat [ function ], first [ function ], float [ function ], forceescape [ function ], format [ function ], groupby [ function ], indent [ function ], int [ function ], join [ function ], last [ function ], length [ builtin_function_or_method ], list [ function ], lower [ function ], map [ function ], min [ function ], max [ function ], pprint [ function ], random [ function ], reject [ function ], rejectattr [ function ], replace [ function ], reverse [ function ], round [ function ], safe [ function ], select [ function ], selectattr [ function ], slice [ function ], sort [ function ], string [ builtin_function_or_method ], striptags [ function ], sum [ function ], title [ function ], trim [ function ], truncate [ function ], unique [ function ], upper [ function ], urlencode [ function ], urlize [ function ], wordcount [ function ], wordwrap [ function ], xmlattr [ function ], tojson [ function ] navigation Navigation Page(title='User manual', url='/V2020/user-manual/') Page(title='Learn more', url='/V2020/learn-more/') Page(title='Installation', url='/V2020/inst/') Page(title='Support', url='/V2020/support/') Page(title='Impressum', url='/V2020/impressum/') files Files page Page Page(title='Info', url='/V2020/info/')","title":"General List"},{"location":"info/#config-information","text":"Standard MkDocs configuration information.

If the conversion doesn't work it will return 0.0 . You can override this default using the first parameter. forceescape function ( value ) Enforce HTML escaping. This will probably double escape variables. format function ( value, args, kwargs ) Apply the given values to a printf-style _ format string, like string % values . groupby function ( args, kwargs, b ) Group a sequence of objects by an attribute using Python's :func: itertools.groupby . The attribute can use dot notation for nested access, like \"address.city\" . Unlike Python's groupby , the values are sorted first so only one group is returned for each unique value. indent function ( s, width, first, blank, newline, rv, lines ) Return a copy of the string with each line indented by 4 spaces. The first line and blank lines are not indented by default. int function ( value, default, base ) Convert the value into an integer. If the conversion doesn't work it will return 0 . You can override this default using the first parameter. You can also override the default base (10) in the second parameter, which handles input with prefixes such as 0b, 0o and 0x for bases 2, 8 and 16 respectively. The base is ignored for decimal numbers and non-string values. join function ( args, kwargs, b ) Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in the sequence. The separator between elements is an empty string per default, you can define it with the optional parameter. last function ( environment, seq ) Return the last item of a sequence. length builtin_function_or_method Return the number of items in a container. list function ( args, kwargs, b ) Convert the value into a list. If it was a string the returned list will be a list of characters. lower function ( s ) Convert a value to lowercase. map function ( args, kwargs, b ) Applies a filter on a sequence of objects or looks up an attribute. This is useful when dealing with lists of objects but you are really only interested in a certain value of it. min function ( environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute ) Return the smallest item from the sequence. max function ( environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute ) Return the largest item from the sequence. pprint function ( value ) Pretty print a variable. Useful for debugging. random function ( context, seq ) Return a random item from the sequence. reject function ( args, kwargs, b ) Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to each object, and rejecting the objects with the test succeeding. rejectattr function ( args, kwargs, b ) Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to the specified attribute of each object, and rejecting the objects with the test succeeding. replace function ( eval_ctx, s, old, new, count ) Return a copy of the value with all occurrences of a substring replaced with a new one. The first argument is the substring that should be replaced, the second is the replacement string. If the optional third argument count is given, only the first count occurrences are replaced. reverse function ( value, rv, e ) Reverse the object or return an iterator that iterates over it the other way round. round function ( value, precision, method, func ) Round the number to a given precision. The first parameter specifies the precision (default is 0 ), the second the rounding method. safe function ( value ) Mark the value as safe which means that in an environment with automatic escaping enabled this variable will not be escaped. select function ( args, kwargs, b ) Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to each object, and only selecting the objects with the test succeeding. selectattr function ( args, kwargs, b ) Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to the specified attribute of each object, and only selecting the objects with the test succeeding. slice function ( args, kwargs, b ) Slice an iterator and return a list of lists containing those items. Useful if you want to create a div containing three ul tags that represent columns. sort function ( environment, value, reverse, case_sensitive, attribute, key_func ) Sort an iterable using Python's :func: sorted . string builtin_function_or_method Convert an object to a string if it isn't already. This preserves a :class: Markup string rather than converting it back to a basic string, so it will still be marked as safe and won't be escaped again. striptags function ( value ) Strip SGML/XML tags and replace adjacent whitespace by one space. sum function ( args, kwargs, b ) Returns the sum of a sequence of numbers plus the value of parameter 'start' (which defaults to 0). When the sequence is empty it returns start. title function ( s ) Return a titlecased version of the value. I.e. words will start with uppercase letters, all remaining characters are lowercase. trim function ( value, chars ) Strip leading and trailing characters, by default whitespace. truncate function ( env, s, length, killwords, end, leeway, result ) Return a truncated copy of the string. The length is specified with the first parameter which defaults to 255 . If the second parameter is true the filter will cut the text at length. Otherwise it will discard the last word. If the text was in fact truncated it will append an ellipsis sign ( \"...\" ). If you want a different ellipsis sign than \"...\" you can specify it using the third parameter. Strings that only exceed the length by the tolerance margin given in the fourth parameter will not be truncated. unique function ( environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute, getter, seen, item, key ) Returns a list of unique items from the given iterable. upper function ( s ) Convert a value to uppercase. urlencode function ( value, items ) Quote data for use in a URL path or query using UTF-8. urlize function ( eval_ctx, value, trim_url_limit, nofollow, target, rel, extra_schemes, policies, rel_parts, scheme, rv ) Convert URLs in text into clickable links. wordcount function ( s ) Count the words in that string. wordwrap function ( environment, s, width, break_long_words, wrapstring, break_on_hyphens ) Wrap a string to the given width. Existing newlines are treated as paragraphs to be wrapped separately. xmlattr function ( eval_ctx, d, autospace, rv ) Create an SGML/XML attribute string based on the items in a dict. All values that are neither none nor undefined are automatically escaped. tojson function ( eval_ctx, value, indent, policies, dumps, kwargs ) Serialize an object to a string of JSON, and mark it safe to render in HTML. This filter is only for use in HTML documents.","title":"Builtin Jinja2 Filters"},{"location":"inst/","text":"Installation - General considerations Overview To install Fiori Tracker please follow the installations guides that are in the Installation section of each component page.

How did the Fiori Tracker address the challenge? The Fiori Tracker keeps the lists of all apps, catalogs and roles in scope.

If the role fits your requirement you can enable the new app by assigning the user to this role.
